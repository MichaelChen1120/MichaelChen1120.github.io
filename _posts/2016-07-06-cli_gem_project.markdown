I put off doing my CLI gem project for about a month mostly because I had no idea what kind of gem to make and the scary prospect of scraping data. Currently taking place is the EURO, a big international soccer tournament that is run every 4 years between qualifying European countries (and England). Being a big soccer fan , I decided to make a gem that scrapes from ESPNFC the most recent results of the tournament and returns data about each game including goals and the match report.

The process of actually making the gem took quite a bit longer than I would've liked and the gem is pretty barebones. The code itself is also currently quite ugly (especially the scrape_games method), but I'm sure that'll get sorted out after the assessment. I'm just elated that it actually works!
