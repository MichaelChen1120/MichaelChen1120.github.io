I took the easy way out when it came to picking a topic for my Sinatra assessment project. Pokemon Go hype was at its peak so it was a no brainer to make a Pokedex app to track a Pokemon collection. The instructions for the project literally read, "...The app should be a custom app that is created to track something important to you..." and for a week or so, those cute digital animals were very important to me. 

Creating my app itself was pretty straightforward. I ended up just copy and pasting a lot of code from previous Sinatra labs and then trying to find areas where I could write helper methods to get rid of some repetition. Naming controllers, routes, and folders was confusing because as far as I know, the plural form of Pokemon is identical to the singular form. I ended up having "pokemons" all over my code, I hope that isn't a problem.

For the forms, I decided to scrape the Pokemon names from a webpage and put them in a drop down menu for users to select when creating and editing Pokemon. I thought it would work and look better opposed to having to type in the names of the Pokemon in a text field. I'm also admittedly terrible at scraping so I figured it'd be good practice. 

The app itself is extremely basic and I'm over Pokemon Go at this point, so I'm hoping it's good enough and I won't have to go back and change a million things like I had to for the CLI gem project . Fingers crossed!
